# 🎬 Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Movie Ticket Sales

This project forecasts cinema ticket sales and detects anomalies using time series (ARIMA, SARIMAX) and machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest).

## 📌 Highlights

- Used Kaggle cinema sales data
- Preprocessed data with log transformation and feature engineering
- Forecasted sales and detected anomalies using residuals
- Compared models using RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R²

## 🛠️ Tools

Python · XGBoost · Statsmodels

## 📈 Best Models

- **ARIMA** – Best forecasting accuracy
- **XGBoost** – Best ML model for non-linear patterns
